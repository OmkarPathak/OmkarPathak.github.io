After refering hundreds of tutorials and guides, I have hosted multiple django websites using Nginx and Apache till date. I faced problems hosting each time with new errors emerging each time. So I thought to write this blog post so that users and developers like me can find a go-to solution (a template kind of thing) to host django applications over Apache 2.4 and Ubuntu.
