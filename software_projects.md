        This small Django application was made in order help a local dairy shop to generate bills in one click. They used to maintain an excel sheet with all the records of customers and their monthly sales. They wanted a system to quickly generate all the bills. They got one and were happy. Earlier they used to use hand written bills which took a lot of time. This system does this in seconds!

        A Django project pretty close to my heart. Tried to replicate basic functionality of Notion app. Stiking features? Fast search, note sharing and encrypted contents! It was thrilling developing this. Simple yet powerful concept for learning any new technology.
